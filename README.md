# Image Processing API V2

    This project is an image processing API which generates an image based on the paramenters the user enters in the query string.
This generated image is then loaded onto the screen, and cached. If the user enters the same parameters as before, the cached
image will be served without producing another request. This project is built with TypeScript and Express. It utilizes the Sharp 
library for image transformation, and Jasmine for testing.
